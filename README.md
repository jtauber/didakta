## Didakta Grammar for Annotation

Didakta Grammar for Annotation is a localizable grammar reference for the ancient Greek language. Didakta has been developed by Farnoosh Shamsian at Leipzig University mainy through rearrangement and reformulation of H. W. Smyth's "Greek Grammar for Colleges" (1920), inspired by "Overview of Greek Syntax" by Jeffrey A. Rydberg-Cox (2000); however, some sections were revised based on recent publications such as the Cambridge Grammar of Classical Greek (Emde Boas et al., 2019).

Didakta Grammar for Annotation is primarily developed as a pedagogical resource to annotate syntactic difficulties that are not referenced in treebanks. While treebanks provide morphological and general syntactic data, Didakta provides more specific information to learners, for example, if a dative noun describes an instrument (e.g., “the hero was struck with a spear”) vs. a location (e.g., “the hero was struck on the shoulder”).

Didakta grammar is relatively modular, meaning that each section barely has a reference to the rest of the grammar and can be used independently. Additionally, the sequence of each section is not significant and can change according to the needs of each learner, course or project. Most importantly, it does not use positive language transfer to explain grammatical concepts. In other words, it does not leverage similarities between Ancient Greek and other languages known to the learners for teaching. Moreover, the text itself has been revised to avoid complex language to minimize inaccuracies in machine translation. Whenever possible, references to the Cambridge Grammar of Classical Greek (Emde Boas et al., 2019) and Pedalion Grammar (Van Hal et al., 2024) have been included in the footnotes.
